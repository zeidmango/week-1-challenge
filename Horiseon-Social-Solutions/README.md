Configuration:
The client would like codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.  We need to locate the source code and find semantic HTML elements.   The HTML elements should follow a logical structure independent of styling and position.  Image elements should also have alt attributes. Images Should be optimized that can be load faster on Chrome.  Heading attributes should fall in sequential order.   The Title element should have a concise descriptive title.
